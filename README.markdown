#django-addressbook 
##A contact management application for the Django web framework.

Addressbook is intended to be a fully pluggable Django application. By this we mean that everything you need to get going - including template files and static media - will be included. Customize as much as you want, but the idea here is to get you up and running as fast as possible.

NOTE: This software is in a pre-alpha state. If you can make use of pieces of this application, by all means, have at it. Be warned, however, that this code may change substantively. If you need the code for a production environment, consider forking.
